# Lego Hierarchical Clustering
## Overview
This project is part of the course "DATA 605 - Actionable Visualizations and Analytics" in the "Master of Data Science and Analytics" program at the "University of Calgary". The goal of the project is to implement hierarchical clustering to find groups of colors in the Lego dataset that have similar characteristics. The project aims to identify the best set of data columns, distance metric, linkage function, and distance threshold for the hierarchical clustering analysis.

## Data
The Lego dataset used for this project contains information about the colors of Lego bricks, including the color name, RGB values, and number of parts in each color. The data was collected from Rebrickable.
We used a filteres and aggregated subset of thsi data from mid-2017, provided by prof. Wesley Willett at the University of Calgary.

## Methodology
The project will be implemented using the Python programming language and the scikit-learn library. The hierarchical clustering algorithm will be applied to the Lego color data to find groups of similar colors based on their RGB values. Different combinations of data columns, distance metrics, linkage functions, and distance thresholds will be tested to identify the best result. The results will be visualized using various plotting techniques.
